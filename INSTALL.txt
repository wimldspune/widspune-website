Please read core/INSTALL.txt for detailed installation instructions for your
Drupal web site.

This project is based on Lando for local setup and composer for managing the dependencies. The development methodology will follow the Gitflow (abridged) development workflow.

1. Login to your github account.
2. Go to the ``widspune-website`` Repository `https://github.com/wimldspune/widspune-website`
3. Request access to organization that owns the project repo in GitLab (if needed).
4. Fork the project repository in GitHub.
5. Clone your forked repository. By default, Git names this "origin" on your local.
    ```
    $ git clone git@github.com:<account name>/widspune-website.git
    ```

6. To ensure that upstream changes to the parent repository may be tracked, add the upstream locally as well.
    ```
    $ git remote add upstream git@github.com:wimldspune/widspune-website.git
    ```

7. Setup Lando locally
---
# Setup local environment.

1. After you have forked and cloned the project. Install Composer Dependencies. (Warning: this can take some time based on internet speeds.)
   ```
    $ lando composer install
   ```

2.  Start Lando
    ```
    $ lando start
    ```

3. Lando will generate the local urls to access the website after Lanod completes the start process.

4. Install local site
    ```
    $ lando drush site-install standard --config-dir=../config/default
    ```
5. More frequently you will use
    ``$ lando drush cim -y``


6. Access the site and do necessary work at #LOCAL_DEV_URL by running the following commands.
    ```
    $ lando drush uli
    ```

7. Set up frontend build and theme.
    ```
    $ cd web/themes/custom/widspune20/
    $ lando composer install
    $ compass compile
